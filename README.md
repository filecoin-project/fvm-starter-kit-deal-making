# Introduction
Welcome to the fevm deal making kit! This kit has several tools to help enable you make storage deals on the Filecoin network via Solidity smart contracts. This kit assumes some knowledge at interacting with the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). If you are new to the FVM, you may want to start with these starter kits instead:

* [FEVM Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-hardhat-kit)
* [FEVM Foundry Starter Kit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-foundry-kit)

Also have a look at this accompanying [Quickstart](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Data-FVM-Getting-Started-with-the-Client-Contract-745e307f48a147148293aebace746c7f) that dives a bit deeper with the resources described in this repo.

The whole flow for deal making (from file upload to making a deal on FVM) is described here:

## Using this Repo

Get started by typing in the following commands into your terminal/command prompt. This will clone the repo and all submodules, switch into the hardhat kit, and install packages: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making.git
cd fvm-starter-kit-deal-making
yarn install
```

Add your private key as an environment variable by running this command, replacing the text *abcdef* with your private key:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

Now type in the following command to deploy the contracts in the kit:

```bash
yarn hardhat deploy
```
Make sure to record the address of where the `DealClient.sol` is deployed for later use.

Now, edit the contract address for your frontend in [Input.js here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making/blob/main/frontend/src/components/Inputs.js#L11).

## (1) Data Prep

Files need to be converted and prepped for storage on Filecoin. 

For any file you want to upload you need to convert it to a .car file and obtain four pieces of information about this file. These are: 

* An https URL to the .car file so storage providers can download it. This is the `carLink`.

* The size of the piece in bytes. This is the `piecesize`. 

* The DataCID of the original raw file. This is essentially a hash that represents the original file. This is known as the `commD` or sometimes the `label`.

* The size of the CAR file that represents the file in bytes. This is known as the `carSize`.

* The PieceCID of the file. This is essentially a hash that represents the .car file. This is also known as the `commP`.


### Option A: Use FVM Tooling

One option is to go to the [FVM Data Depot](https://data.lighthouse.storage/), upload the file you want to store on Filecoin, and the tool will generate all the information we discussed. 

**Note**: The data depot is only meant as an intermediate step to get your data to the storage providers. It will hold your files for 30 days before the link to your car file expires. After this, storage providers will not be able to retrieve your file to store it more permanentaly.

### Option B: Use the generate-car tool locally

Another option is to use the [`generate-car`](https://github.com/tech-greedy/generate-car) tool, written in the language Go, and included as a submodule within this repo.

If you are currently in this repo's directory, run these commands to switch into the proper directory and build the tool:

```bash
cd generate-car
make build
```

Now you can create a directory for the tools output and use the utility as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir out
$ ./generate-car --single -i /path/to/file/A.txt -o out -p /path/to/file/
```

You should get a json file that looks like this:
```json
{"Ipld":{"Name":"","Hash":"bafybeieawlmgtnb455ynra7kxyzipvhfxrms5yeuylr4w7dbpx7w4e6tqe","Size":0,"Link":[{"Name":"shapes.png","Hash":"bafybeigeisbcozxm7xyuf6vviijjg5fm2ptha2ciuyvjfdaedunhdfwsee","Size":1687130,"Link":null}]},"DataCid":"bafybeieawlmgtnb455ynra7kxyzipvhfxrms5yeuylr4w7dbpx7w4e6tqe","PieceCid":"baga6ea4seaqesm5ghdwocotmdavlrrzssfl33xho6xtrr5grwyi5gj3vtairaoq","PieceSize":2097152,"CidMap":{"":{"IsDir":true,"Cid":"bafybeieawlmgtnb455ynra7kxyzipvhfxrms5yeuylr4w7dbpx7w4e6tqe"},"shapes.png":{"IsDir":false,"Cid":"bafybeigeisbcozxm7xyuf6vviijjg5fm2ptha2ciuyvjfdaedunhdfwsee"}}}
```

Note that this results in a `PieceSize`, `PieceCID`, `DataCID` and `Size` is the `CarSize`. 

As a result of the above, you should also get a `.car` file. You can upload this file to any http endpoint of your choice. Any example is using [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage/). Sign in, upload the `.car` file, click on the CID column, and once you get to the IPFS portal right click on the `Copy Link Location`. You should get a link that looks something like this: https://bafybeif74tokne4wvxsrcsxh6dhrzv6ys7mtifhwzaen7jfjuvltean32a.ipfs.w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeif74tokne4wvxsrcsxh6dhrzv6ys7mtifhwzaen7jfjuvltean32a/baga6ea4seaqesm5ghdwocotmdavlrrzssfl33xho6xtrr5grwyi5gj3vtairaoq.car

This link is `carLink` for your file.


## (2) Creating a Deal Proposal Payload

Because of the way the client contract is set up, you need to prepare a deal proposal payload and call `makeDealProposal` with this payload. The payload consists of these solidity structs (which can be found [here in the Client Contract](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-hardhat-kit/blob/main/contracts/basic-deal-client/DealClient.sol#L38)):


Here is an example with these fields initialized:

```javascript
  const DealRequestStruct = [
    "baga6ea4seaqesm5ghdwocotmdavlrrzssfl33xho6xtrr5grwyi5gj3vtairaoq", // pieceCID (Generated in previous step)
    262144, // pieceSize (Generated in previous step)
    false, // verifiedDeal (whether the deal has datacap or not)
    "baga6ea4seaqesm5ghdwocotmdavlrrzssfl33xho6xtrr5grwyi5gj3vtairaoq", // DataCID (generated in previous step)
    520000, // startEpoch (when you want the storage to start)
    1555200, // endEpoch (when you want the storage to end)
    0, // storagePricePerEpoch (how much attoFIL per GiB per 30s you are offering for this deal, set to 0 for a free deal)
    0, // providerCollateral (how much collateral the provider must put up for the deal)
    0, // clientCollateral (how much collateral you, the client, must put up for the deal)
    1, // extraParamsVersion (set to 1)
    extraParamsV1, // see below
  ];

    const extraParamsV1 = [
    "https://bafybeif74tokne4wvxsrcsxh6dhrzv6ys7mtifhwzaen7jfjuvltean32a.ipfs.w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeif74tokne4wvxsrcsxh6dhrzv6ys7mtifhwzaen7jfjuvltean32a/baga6ea4seaqesm5ghdwocotmdavlrrzssfl33xho6xtrr5grwyi5gj3vtairaoq.car", // carLink (Generated in previous step)
    236445, // carSize (Generated in previous step).
    false, // skipIpniAnnounce (whether or not the deal should be announced to IPNI indexers, set to false)
    false, // removeUnsealedCopy (whether or not the storage provider should remove an unsealed copy. Set to false)
  ];
```

## (3) Calling the makeDealProposal method



### Option A: Use the dapp frontend

Take the four outputs of part (I) and put each into the four fields of the [frontend in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making/tree/main/frontend). 

Once the deal handshake is completed (described more in part III), you should be able to see the deal ID for this transaction in Filfox on the frontend. Here is a previous example of a DealID submitted through the frontend: https://calibration.filfox.info/en/deal/1016

### Option B: Use the hardhat task

You can also call the method by running the make-deal-proposal task. Below is an example of how to run the task. Make sure to replace any values with your own.

```bash
yarn hardhat make-deal-proposal --contract 0xD4aac4D8fBc7575bDf5C19f900634d6c61a00a79 --piece-cid baga6ea4seaqayn6kwvhnajfgec2qakj7vb5aeqisbbnojunowdyapkdfcyhzcpy --piece-size 262144 --verified-deal false --label "baga6ea4seaqayn6kwvhnajfgec2qakj7vb5aeqisbbnojunowdyapkdfcyhzcpy" --start-epoch 520000 --end-epoch 1555200 --storage-price-per-epoch 0 --provider-collateral 0 --client-collateral 0 --extra-params-version 1 --location-ref "https://data-depot.lighthouse.storage/api/download/download_car?fileId=005b377e-89a6-44c6-aa04-871509019bec.car" --car-size 194875 --skip-ipni-announce false --remove-unsealed-copy false
```

## (4) Boost Provider Picks up Deal

The Client Contract (CC) is built to interact with Boost SPs and generate deals on behalf of a client, entirely on-chain.

The CC primarily interacts with the Boost SPs through an event known as `DealProposalCreate`, which looks like this:

```solidity
event DealProposalCreate(
    bytes32 indexed id,
    uint64 size,
    bool indexed verified,
    uint256 price
);
```

The payload we generated earlier is then picked up by the storage provider.

The overall flow is a push-pull mechanism. The CC "pushes" a `DealProposalCreate` event onto the FVM event log, which is watched by Boost SPs. SPs look for `DealProposalCreate` events that interest them (they can filter by price, verified state and size). They then ask the CC to provide them the `DealProposal` payload. Data transfer can begin. SPs can also publish the deal by submitting a PublishStorageDeal message on-chain with the fields in the DealProposal payload.

See the diagram of this information here:

In summary, the "front-end" of the CC interacts with the contract, and takes in a deal proposal payload. The "back-end" of the CC interacts with the Boost SP in order to generate the deal, as well as in order to authenticate the deal. 

Note that we have a few active threads and FRCs where the client contract is being discussed:
